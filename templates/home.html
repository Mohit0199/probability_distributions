    <h2>Probability Distributions</h2>
    <p>
        Probability distributions are fundamental in statistics and probability theory.
        They allow us to grasp the likelihood of different outcomes in random events.
        Consider scenarios like rolling a die or predicting the weather â€” probability distributions
        provide a method to quantify the probability of each potential outcome.<br>
        There are primarily two types of distributions: discrete and continuous.
        Discrete distributions, such as those seen in dice rolls, assume distinct values.
        Continuous distributions, on the other hand, cover a range of possible values,
        making them suitable for measurements like temperature or height.<br>
        Each distribution possesses a unique shape, defined by parameters like mean (average) and variance (spread).
        For instance, the normal distribution is recognized for its bell-shaped curve, where the majority of data
        points gather around the mean.<br>
        These distributions are invaluable across various fields, aiding statisticians, scientists, and analysts
        in making predictions, testing hypotheses, and uncovering patterns in data.
